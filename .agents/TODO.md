# Future Work & Pending Tasks (TODO)

This document tracks pending architectural improvements and technical debt.

## 1. Migrate off the deprecated controller-runtime events API
- **Context:** `internal/controller/edgenode_controller.go` uses `mgr.GetEventRecorderFor` with a `record.EventRecorder` field.
- **Task:** Migrate to the new events API (`mgr.GetEventRecorder` returning `events.EventRecorder`) and rewrite every `.Event()` call to `Eventf` with the regarding/related/action signature.
- **When:** Only once controller-runtime announces actual removal of the classic API; today it is still supported and the migration touches every event call site for no functional gain.

## 2. Optional passive outlier detection on the Envoy upstreams
- **Context:** Envoy already active-health-checks each uplink's `/ready` (`spec.edge.healthCheck`), so a downed replica is ejected after roughly `interval * unhealthyThreshold` (~10s with the defaults). During that detection window new connections round-robined onto the just-failed replica still fail (connect timeout or RST).
- **Task:** Add optional passive ejection (`outlier_detection` in the CDS cluster) so a replica is dropped on the first real connection failures, without waiting for the active-check threshold. Tuneable from a new `spec.edge.outlierDetection` block (`enabled`, `consecutiveFailures`, `ejectionDuration`), off by default, defaults applied in the planner like `healthCheck`.
- **When:** Only if the ~10s window during a single-uplink failure proves too painful in practice. Active health checks already cover the steady state and the all-down case (`healthy_panic_threshold` is hard-coded to 0 for fast failure); this only tightens the transient. Keep it out of scope until there is a real need, to avoid the flapping and tuning surface it adds.

## 3. Let `tunnelctl` also apply the Envoy config
- **Context:** On the edge, Envoy LDS/CDS are pushed as files that Envoy hot-reloads on its own. Today the operator writes them over SSH, separately from the WireGuard document that `tunnelctl` applies.
- **Task:** Add an optional `envoy` section to the `tunnelctl` desired-state document (the rendered LDS/CDS) so `apply` writes those files atomically and `status` reports Envoy health (active + loaded config hash) alongside WireGuard. One `apply`/`status` per node, with the symmetry `wireguard` + routing (`envoy` on the edge, `nftables` on the uplink).
- **Boundary:** `tunnelctl` applies config only. Installing the Envoy binary, the immutable bootstrap and the systemd unit stay in the operator enroll (one-time host setup tied to `--envoy-version`).
- **When:** The WireGuard + nftables document already ships and is applied natively by `tunnelctl`; this extends the same document with the Envoy section.

## 4. Userspace WireGuard fallback (wireguard-go / boringtun) for hosts without the kernel module
- **Context:** `tunnelctl` programs WireGuard through the kernel module. Hosts without it (OpenVZ/LXC "VPS", very old or minimal kernels) cannot bring the interface up.
- **Task:** When the kernel module is absent, fall back to a userspace data plane (`wireguard-go`, or `boringtun` if it benchmarks better) shipped as a static binary like `tunnelctl`. The `wgctrl` configuration path is unchanged (same UAPI), so only interface creation/teardown differs behind the existing backend seam in `internal/wg`. Note this fallback IS a genuine resident daemon on the host (the userspace data plane), unlike the kernel path.
- **Does NOT change privileges:** userspace WireGuard still needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (creating the TUN via `/dev/net/tun` + `TUNSETIFF`, and the address/MTU/up/route netlink calls that are shared with the kernel backend). It only removes the kernel-module dependency, not the root/cap requirement (see item 5).
- **When:** Choose wireguard-go vs boringtun by performance.

## 5. Run the uplink without root (CAP_NET_ADMIN via file capabilities)
- **Context:** The uplink container runs as root (`gcr.io/distroless/static:latest`) because creating the WireGuard link and programming nftables go through netlink, which needs an effective `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. A non-root uid does not get caps in its effective set even in a privileged pod (we hit `operation not permitted` with the `:nonroot` image), so root is the simple path today.
- **Task:** Drop root (and ideally `privileged`) by giving the binary file capabilities: `setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/local/bin/uplink` in `Dockerfile.uplink`, run as a non-root uid, and add `securityContext.capabilities.add: [NET_ADMIN]` (the bounding set the file cap is raised into). This is independent of the WireGuard backend (works for the kernel path and item 4's userspace path; the latter also needs `/dev/net/tun` mounted). Kubernetes ambient capabilities would be the cleaner mechanism but are still alpha/poorly exposed, so file caps are the pragmatic route.
- **When:** Only if running the data-plane pod as root/privileged becomes a real concern (hardened clusters, PSA `restricted`). Not urgent.

## 6. Verify the downloaded Envoy binary against a known checksum
- **Context:** `provision.installEnvoyBinary` downloads the Envoy release over HTTPS from the official GitHub releases and runs it with no integrity check beyond TLS. A compromised mirror/redirect, a truncated download or a corrupted artifact would be installed and started as the sole public-facing process on the VPS.
- **Task:** Pin the expected SHA-256 per `--envoy-version` (a small embedded map, or a sidecar `.sha256` fetched from the same release and verified) and have the install command compute and compare the digest before the atomic `mv` into `/usr/local/bin/envoy`; fail the enroll loudly on mismatch. Keep it arch-aware (amd64/arm64 differ).
- **When:** Worth doing as supply-chain hardening; the edge binary is security-sensitive. Low effort once the per-version digests are tracked alongside `DefaultEnvoyVersion`.

## 7. Reject a direct-address PortBinding target without a port at admission
- **Context:** The CRD CEL rules enforce "exactly one of `target.service` / `target.address`" but cannot require `target.port` when `address` is used: `port` is an optional non-pointer int, so an omitted value serialises as absent and slips past the `Minimum=1` marker. `planner.resolveTarget` then rejects `port <= 0` at reconcile time, surfacing as `PlanBuildFailed` on the EdgeNode rather than as a clear admission error on the offending PortBinding.
- **Task:** Add an XValidation rule on PortBinding requiring `target.port` to be set (and in range) whenever `target.address` is set, so the bad spec is rejected at apply time with a precise message instead of failing a downstream EdgeNode reconcile. Keep the planner check as defense-in-depth.
- **When:** Small, purely additive validation; do it next time the API CRDs are regenerated (it is a three-part CRD edit per DESIGN_AND_RULES §5).

## 8. Honour the context in `agentrun.Run` for graceful shutdown
- **Context:** `agentrun.Run(ctx, ...)` takes a context but never observes it: it starts `watchConfig` and `srv.ListenAndServe()` and only returns on a server error. The `ctx` parameter is silently ignored, so the daemon relies on the container being SIGKILL'd. Harmless in the uplink pod today, but a function that accepts a `ctx` and drops it is a smell and blocks any clean in-process shutdown/testing.
- **Task:** Wire `ctx` through: stop the fsnotify watcher and call `srv.Shutdown(ctx)` when `ctx` is done (run `ListenAndServe` in a goroutine, select on `ctx.Done()`), and treat `http.ErrServerClosed` as a clean exit. Have `tunnelctl run` pass a signal-bound context instead of `context.Background()`.
- **When:** Low priority (no production impact), but cheap and removes the dropped-parameter smell.

*Items 9–18 come from the June 2026 robustness audit (3 workers + manual confirmation against the code; `make verify` green incl. race). Severity noted per item. These are the agreed working set.*

## 9. [HIGH] ~~EdgeNode reconcile hot loop: status update re-queues itself~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** `For()` now carries `predicate.Or(GenerationChangedPredicate, AnnotationChangedPredicate, LabelChangedPredicate)` (`edgeNodeEventPredicate`), and `updateStatusAndReturn` skips the `Status().Update()` when the status is semantically DeepEqual to the snapshot taken after the Get. Regression tests: a status-write-counting client wrapper proves the second reconcile performs zero status writes (mutation-tested: fails with the skip disabled), plus direct predicate assertions (status-only → no enqueue; generation/annotation/label change → enqueue).

## 10. [HIGH] ~~Envoy admin address hardcoded to `10.200.0.1` in the bootstrap~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** the planner now exposes `Plan.RelayIP` (already embedded in RelayDocument, so its hash covers changes; PlanHash untouched) and `ensureEnvoyRunning` templates the admin address from it, failing loudly when empty. The bootstrap delivery is change-aware without touching State: the remote `/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml` is compared with the desired content — identical means no Put and no restart, different/missing means Put + restart (Envoy only reads the bootstrap at startup, so a relay-network change now actually takes effect). Default-network nodes get byte-identical content, so upgrading the operator causes zero restarts. Tests mutation-verified (hardcoded-IP, never-diff and always-diff mutants all killed).

## 11. [HIGH] ~~known_hosts verification ignores the hostname~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** `knownHostsCallback` now delegates to `x/crypto/ssh/knownhosts.New` (hostname-aware matching, [host]:port entries, hashed entries, @revoked markers). The Secret blob is written to a temp file (knownhosts.New only takes paths; parsed eagerly, removed right after; host public keys are not secret material). A pre-validation pass preserves the clear malformed/empty errors, and verification failures wrap `*knownhosts.KeyError` so callers can inspect them. Canary test verified against the old code: a key pinned for host A is now rejected for host B (the old callback accepted any key in the blob for any host). Operational note: for non-standard SSH ports the Secret must contain `[host]:port` entries (`ssh-keyscan -p` produces them).

## 12. [MEDIUM] ~~Enroll early-exit misses `TunnelctlHash` and `EnvoyVersion` (silently ineffective upgrades)~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** the local tunnelctl binary hash is now resolved before the early-exit (new `resolveTunnelctlBinary` helper; one extra cheap `uname -m` per steady-state pass) and both `state.TunnelctlHash` and the new `state.EnvoyVersion` field joined the early-exit condition. `installEnvoyBinary` now probes and downloads in separate steps, returning `replaced`; when the binary was replaced, `Enroll` calls `RestartEnvoy` after `ensureEnvoyRunning` so the running process actually picks up the new release (a live systemd service never re-reads its binary). Pre-existing VPSes have an empty `state.EnvoyVersion`, which forces one idempotent pass that backfills it — no migration. Canaries mutation-verified against the old code (tunnelctl push and curl+restart both fail there).

## 13. [MEDIUM] ~~Orphaned kernel routes on uplink scale-down~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** `Apply` now reconciles routes after installing them: the netlink glue lives in `syncRoutes(link, cfg)` and the pure `staleRoutes(cfg, installed)` flags the routes no current peer allowed-IP justifies; each one is `RouteDel`'d. Kernel-originated routes (`RTPROT_KERNEL`) and routes with nil Dst are never touched. Mutation-tested, and `TestSyncRoutes_Kernel` exercises the real netlink path (dummy interface, TEST-NET-2 addresses) when run as root; it self-skips with an explicit NOT TESTED log otherwise.

## 14. [MEDIUM] ~~`spec.uplink.namespace` is mutable and orphans resources on teardown~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** field-level CEL immutability rule (`+kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self == oldSelf"`, message "uplink.namespace is immutable") on `UplinkSpec.Namespace`. The default (`tunnel`) is applied at admission, so `oldSelf` is always populated and the rule also covers specs that omitted the field. Three-part edit done per DESIGN_AND_RULES §5: CRDs regenerated, synced to `deploy/helm/tunnel/crds/`, sample comment updated. `make verify` green.

## 15. [MEDIUM] ~~Initial `Apply` in `agentrun` has no retry~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** a failed initial apply now spawns a background retry loop with exponential backoff (1s floor, 60s cap) that reloads the document on each attempt (so a config fix is picked up) and stops as soon as ANY apply succeeds, including one performed by the config watcher. Apply calls from the retry loop and the watcher are serialized through a shared `applyState` (mutex + success flag). Mutation-tested: removing the success short-circuit and freezing the backoff both fail the suite.

## 16. [MEDIUM] ~~`EnvoyVersion` interpolated into VPS shell without sanitisation~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** `installEnvoyBinary` rejects any version that is not bare semver (`^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`) before any remote command runs (mutation-tested: gutting the guard fails the suite; injection payloads never reach the FakeExecutor). The controller's `DefaultEnvoyVersion` fallback keeps production plans always valid; the Enroll test plans gained the explicit version they implicitly relied on.

## 17. [MEDIUM] ~~PortBinding `Ready=True` means "triggered", not "applied"~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed:** Gateway API-style condition pair, reconcilers coupled only through the API server. `EdgeNodeStatus` gained `appliedBindings` (sorted namespace/name set, listType=set), written by the EdgeNodeReconciler after each successful enroll. The PortBindingReconciler sets `Programmed=True` on trigger (the old Ready semantics) and `Ready=True` (reason `Applied`) only when its key appears in the referenced EdgeNode's `appliedBindings`; missing node ⇒ `EdgeNodeNotFound`, not yet in plan ⇒ `NotYetApplied`. A `Watches(&EdgeNode{})` with a mapping func re-enqueues the node's bindings on status change (this watch deliberately reacts to status updates; the EdgeNode's own For() predicate from item 9 filters them out, predicates are per-watch so they don't clash). envtest specs cover both states + the mapping func; mutation check on evaluateApplied passes (always-True killed). PENDING live validation: end-to-end Ready transition against a real VPS (the full sync path needs SSH).

## 18. [MEDIUM] ~~Grouped minor findings from the audit~~ ✅ DONE (jun 2026)
- **Fixed, all seven in one pass:**
  - `mapSecretToEdgeNodes` logs List failures (a missed TLS rotation now leaves a trace).
  - RBAC trimmed: no `create`/`delete` on `edgenodes`/`portbindings` (markers + Helm rbac.yaml).
  - Secrets watch filtered by the `tlsSecretShaped` predicate (type `kubernetes.io/tls` or a `tls.crt` key). Trims reconcile churn, NOT cache memory: a cache-level selector would break the SSH/uplink-key Secret Gets through the cached client; documented in the predicate.
  - ipam computes host offsets over the full 32-bit address (`hostAt`): non-.0-aligned bases (`10.200.0.128/25` → relay `.129`) and >/24 networks (offsets cross octet boundaries) work; broadcast rejected per-prefix.
  - Planner rejects PortBindings on reserved ports 8080 (uplink readiness) and 9901 (Envoy admin/metrics) with a named-owner error.
  - `BuildHeadlessService` + `createOrUpdateHeadlessService`: the STS `spec.serviceName` reference now resolves (ClusterIP None, selector-only; services RBAC gained create/update/patch).
  - `--leader-elect` defaults to true (binary flag + Helm values), single SSH writer per VPS guaranteed across replicas.
